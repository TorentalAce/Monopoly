Welcome to Monopoly!

To run, navigate to the Monopoly folder and run the following command:
Python3 monopoly_sim.py

This project aims to look at monopoly games simulated by different AI and conditions (specialized game modes) to take a more unique look at the game.
- Currently, only 1 controller is available as a very basic AI, however more will be added in the future to simulate both most-effecient and human-like gameplay.
- Additionally, as more controllers are added and game options, command-line parameters will be added to account for them.

Currently the game functions akin to a normal game of Monopoly, with the following simplifications:
- Mortgaging currently functions as just selling the property back to the bank
- Trading/Voluntary selling has no functionality (as the base AI wouldn't use it anyway as per the specifications)
